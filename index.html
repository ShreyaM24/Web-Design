				The purpose of having different headings is to signify the importance of certain concepts. If the topic is general then the largest heading can be used and the more specfic a topic gets the smaller the heading would become. It helps the user understand which topics are more important and which topics go along with each other.

				I learned the basics of a webpages and websites.I learned that these webpages and websites use HTML and CSS.I also learned that the content of a webpage is crucial to understand for the user to understand the purpose of the webpage or website. The layout and presentation is a significant factor that influences the looks of the website or webpage. The main difference between a webpage and a website is that a website involves many while webpagesdo not involve anything else within it.
