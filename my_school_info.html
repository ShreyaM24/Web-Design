		I chose to take Public Speaking and Introducntion to Computer Science because they will help me in my future education anc career. Public Speaking, taught by Mr. Rizzo, helped me become a strong speaker. Introduction to Computer Science, taught by Ms. Ashish, teaches me a lot about coding and copmuters. Both of which are concepts I will be using in my upcoming future. Physical Education/Health, taught by Mr. Lloyd, is a requirement that is supposed to keep mme active and make sure I am aware of my body. Taking Spanish 1, taught by Ms. Wagstaff, will help me communicate with other people for it teaches me the basics of spanish. History taught me about the past and what I should do in the future. Biology Honors, taught by Ms. Jacobsen, showed me all the little things about biology. English, taught by Ms. Fecher, helped me analyze literature. Algebra 2, taught by Mr. Guire, helped me understand the depths of math. Mr. Montalto is the conductor for concert band and this class does not feel like a class. I get to play the flute in this class and enjoy the time I have there.
