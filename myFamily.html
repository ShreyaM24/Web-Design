	<p> 
		My sister's name is Kashika Manak. She is a very smart girl even though she is only 10 years old and in 4th grade. Kashika is great at understanding other people's situations(her maturity level is sometimes levels higher than mine) is awesome at singing and playing the piano and saxophone. Kashika is also naturally good at field hockey, lacrosse, and basketball. She may be a pain in the neck sometimes, but I don't mind her being my personal pain in the neck.

	<p>
    	My mother's name is Sushma Manak. She is very hard-working and makes sure that her children always are her first priorty. Somehow she has the ability to drive my sister and I without getting tired. She is great at cooking food. I also think she is a phsycic who knows every action or word I am going to take or say beforehand. I love the conversations that I have with her, I am always at ease when I talk to her.Sometimes we have to agree to disagree, but in the end we still greatly love each other.

	<h3>
        MY FATHER
	</h3>

	<p>
    	My father's name is Kapil Manak. he is naturally funny but sometimes he gets really sensitive. Whenever something emotional is coming on TV, I can always turn around and find my father on the verge of tears. he also is very hard-working like my mother. he works in the software industry. he has previously worked with an app and is currently working with the PGA tour website. My father's range of emotions and capabilties is something that I will always strive to have.
